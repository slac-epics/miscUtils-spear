#RELEASE Location of external products
# Run "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the application
# top directory each time this file is changed.

# EPICS_BASE usually appears last so other apps can override stuff:
#EPICS_BASE=/afs/slac/g/spear/epics/base
#INSTALL_LOCATION_APP=$(TOP)/../..
#include $(TOP)/../../../configure/RELEASE-master

include $(TOP)/../../../RELEASE_SITE_7.0.3.1-1.0_sdf
EPICS_BASE=$(BASE_SITE_TOP)/$(BASE_MODULE_VERSION)
