/* Unified device support for simple, bus-mapped device registers */

/* A helper routine to parse the INP link field. Since there
 * are not too many link types, we must use VME for everything :-(
 * The idea is as follows:
 * 
 *  The INP/OUT link field is set to something like:
 *  #C<inst> S<shift> @<theDevice>+<offset>,<method>
 *
 *  <theDevice> is a device name string that is looked-up in the
 *  registry, i.e. the device driver must have stored it there
 *  (using the 'devBusMappedRegister()' wrapper).
 *
 *  The device may support multiple (identical) 'subdevices' or
 *  'channels' which can be found at
 *
 *   <base address> + (<inst> << <shift>)
 *
 *  Finally, the <offset> is added to calculate the real register
 *  address.
 *
 *  <method> may be any of 'be8[s]','be16[s]','be32','le16[s]','le32',
 *  'm8', 'm16[s]', or 'm32[s]' to specify the access method that
 *  should be used (big/little/cpu endian, data width; the optional
 *  's' [e.g. le16s] indicates that the short little endian data are
 *  signed). If no <method> is specified, *  "be32" is assumed.
 *  The 'm' methods are appropriate to access variables in memory
 *  (cpu endianness).
 *
 *  In addition, user supported access methods are supported. A driver
 *  can register its own DevBusMappedAccessRec with a call to
 *  'devBusMappedRegisterIO()' which is then free to do any kind
 *  of fancy things at a low level.
